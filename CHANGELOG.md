# Changelog

All notable changes to µShader are documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Repository structure bootstrapped: `LICENSE` (MIT), `README.md`,
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `.gitignore`, `VERSION`.
- CMake skeleton (C++20, MSVC toolchain, Windows 10/11 only) with
  version stamping from the `VERSION` file into a generated
  `version.h`.
- Dependency fetching wired up via CMake `FetchContent`: SDL3, Dear
  ImGui (docking branch), stb single-header libraries.
- First buildable milestone: an application that opens an SDL3 window
  with an OpenGL context and closes cleanly.
